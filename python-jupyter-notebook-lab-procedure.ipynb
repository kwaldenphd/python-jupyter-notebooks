    "\n",
    "1. Up to this point, we have used the browser-based IDE [Replit](https://repl.it/).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is an IDE? \"An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of at least a source code editor, build automation tools and a debugger\" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment)).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. An IDE can include features like syntax highlighting, code completion, version control, and debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. There are a WIDE range of IDEs that are proprietary or open-source, tailored to a specific language or able to work across languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Some common IDEs include Eclipse, Geany, Brackets, Atom, PyCharm, Spyder, RStudio, etc. For more in IDEs, visit Wikipedia's [\"Comparison of integrated development environments\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_integrated_development_environments) page.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Replit (generally) worked for (most of) our needs. But it ran into problems with more complex programs or programs involving external files/datasets/etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "7. Now, we're going to install Python on your local computer, using a distribution called Anaconda.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. What is Anaconda? \"Anaconda is a open-source distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing (data science, machine learning applications, large-scale data processing, predictive analytics, etc.), that aims to simplify package management and deployment. The distribution includes data-science packages suitable for Windows, Linux, and macOS. It is developed and maintained by Anaconda, Inc., which was founded by Peter Wang and Travis Oliphant in 2012\" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaconda_(Python_distribution))).\n",
    "\n",
    "9. The Anaconda environment includes a number of specific tools and programs, including:\n",
    "- JupyterLab\n",
    "- Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "- Qt Console\n",
    "- Spyder\n",
    "- Glue\n",
    "- Orange\n",
    "- RStudio\n",
    "- Visual Code Studio\n",
    "\n",
    "10. This lab introduces us to using Jupyter Notebooks through Anaconda. It also includes resources for [getting started in Google Colab](https://github.com/kwaldenphd/python-jupyter-notebooks/blob/main/google-colab-instructions.md), a browser-based Jupyter Notebooks environment.\n",

    "# Python in Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "14. What is Jupyter?\n",
    "\n",
    "15. \"Project Jupyter is a non-profit, open-source project, born out of the IPython Project in 2014 as it evolved to support interactive data science and scientific computing across all programming languages. Jupyter will always be 100% open-source software, free for all to use and released under the liberal terms of the modified BSD license\" ([\"About Us\"](https://jupyter.org/about), *Jupyter.org*)\n",
    "\n",
    "16. Project Jupyter receives funding from a range of non-profit foundations and corporate partners that include:\n",
    "- Alfred P. Sloan Foundation\n",
    "- Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation\n",
    "- Google\n",
    "- Microsoft\n",
    "\n",
    "17. Institutional partners for Project Jupyter include:\n",
    "- Apple\n",
    "- Bloomberg\n",
    "- Netflix\n",
    "- Cal Poly\n",
    "- Berkeley\n",
    "- Amazon Web Services (AWS)\n",
    "\n",
    "18. The name Jupyter is a reference to the three core languages supported by the project: **Ju**lia, **Py**thon, and **R**.\n",
    "\n",
    "19. And what is a Jupyter notebook?\n",
    "\n",
    "20. According to \"[The Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html)\" documentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "<blockquote>The notebook extends the console-based approach to interactive computing in a qualitatively new direction, providing a web-based application suitable for capturing the whole computation process: developing, documenting, and executing code, as well as communicating the results. The Jupyter notebook combines two components:\n",
    " <ul>\n",
    "  <li>A web application: a browser-based tool for interactive authoring of documents which combine explanatory text, mathematics, computations and their rich media output.</li>\n",
    "  <li>Notebook documents: a representation of all content visible in the web application, including inputs and outputs of the computations, explanatory text, mathematics, images, and rich media representations of objects</li>\n",
    " </ul>\n",
    " </blockquote>\n",
    "\n",
    "21. A Jupyter notebook is a file (the notebook document) that displays or renders in a web browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "22. We'll be launching Jupyter Notebooks through Anaconda. \n",
    "\n",
    "23. The web application component of the notebook will be hosted on your local computer and the notebook document will save to a file directory on your local computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://github.com/kwaldenphd/python-jupyter-notebooks/blob/main/images/Figure_1.png?raw=true\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://github.com/kwaldenphd/python-jupyter-notebooks/blob/main/images/Figure_1.png?raw=true\" /></a></p>\n",

    "25. When in a new notebook document, you have four main components to the user interface:\n",
    "- Notebook name\n",
    "- Menu bar\n",
    "- Toolbar\n",
    "- Code cell\n",
    "\n",
    "26. The notebook name is what the `.ipynb` file created via the Jupyter notebook will be saved as.\n",
    "\n",
    "27. Click on the default notebook name (usually `Untitled`) to rename the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "28. The menu bar includes drop-down options used to manipulate the notebook functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "29. The toolbar icons give you quick access to the most commonly-used features of the notebook environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "30. Code cells are the default type of cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "31. But why are there cells?\n",
    "\n",
    "32. Jupyter notebooks consist of a sequence of cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "33. A cell is a multiline text input field. \n",
    "\n",
    "34. You can execute the contents of a cell by using `Shift-Enter`, clicking the `Play` button in the toolbar, or the `Cell` and `Run` icons in the menu bar.\n",
    "\n",
    "35. How a cell executes is determined by its type.\n",
    "\n",
    "36. There are three types of Jupyter notebook cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "37. ***Code cells*** allow you to edit and write code with full syntax highlighting and tab completion.\n",
    "\n",
    "38. ***Markdown cells*** allow you to document the computational process using descriptive text formatted using the markdown language.\n",
    "\n",
    "39. ***Raw cells*** allow you to write output directly. These cells are not evaluated by the notebook and render unmodified.\n",
    "\n",
    "40. You can edit or work within a code cell until you get the desired output, then move on to a new cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "41. You can use markdown cells along the way to document your process using narrative text (alongside or in addition to code comments used in code cells).\n",
    "\n",
    "42. To learn more about formatting text in markdown, visit Adam Pritchard's [\"Markdown Cheatsheet\"](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) resource page.\n",
    "\n",
    "43. You can download a Jupyter notebook as a `.ipynb` file (this is the default option).\n",
    "\n",
    "44. You can also use the `File` - `Download as` menu options to download the notebook in a number of other formats, including `.py`, `.pdf`, or `.html`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<blockquote>To learn more about configuring Jupyter Notebooks to download notebooks as PDFs:\n",

    " </blockquote>\n",
    "\n",
    "45. There's a lot to love about Jupyter notebooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "46. A few challenges or drawbacks:\n",
    "- Version control especially in collaborative environments is virtually impossible\n",
    "- Jupyter lacks the debugging tools and autocompletion features of an IDE\n",
    "- Testing and debugging code is virtually impossible\n",
    "- Installing third-party packages or modules can be tricky \n",
    "- Jupyter's non-linear workflow limits transparent reproducible code\n",
    "- Jupyter doesn't play well with external big data applications (spark/dask/distributed)\n",

    "\n",
    "47. So when could you use Jupyter notebooks? \n",
    "\n",
    "48. Jupyter notebooks are fantastic tools for exploration. \n",
    "\n",
    "49. They also work well for documenting process, or in situations when you might need to alternate between code and other kinds of text (like say in a lab notebook).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing packages in Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "50. In a previous lab, we mentioned how you can use modules, libraries, and packages to extend Python's functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "51. That previous lab used the built-in `csv` and `json` modules. \n",
    "\n",
    "52. We did not need to install those modules since they are already included in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "53. All we had to do was use an `import` statement to bring those modules into our Python program."

    "93. Spyder has three default panes that show up when you launch the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "94. Your `.py` file shows up on the left-hand side of the program window. This is where you will write Python code. You can have multiple `.py` files open in Spyder and navigate between the tabs. \n",
    "\n",
    "95. The top-right pane has four default options:\n",
    "- Variable explorer, which lets you see named variables in your program\n",
    "- Help, which provides additional documentation, information, or resources\n",
    "- Plots, which will show visualizations generated by your program\n",
    "- Files, which will show all files currently open or active in your Spyder workspace\n",

    "\n",
    "97. So how is the Console different from your `.py` file?\n",
    "\n",
    "98. In the `.py` file you are writing a Python program that will run or execute when the file is called. You make updates to that file, save changes, etc.\n",

    "# Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "110. To paraphrase an old programming joke, writing code is 90% of the work of programming. Debugging is the other 90%.\n",
    "\n",
    "111. You've been working on a program for hours, your head hurts, and something still isn't working. We all know a version of that feeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "112. There's no easy solution that will prevent all problems (or \"bugs\") in your code. But having strategies for testing your code, recognizing and making sense of error messages, and methodically debugging your code can help immensely.\n",
    "\n",
    "113. Python errors will usually fall into three types: syntax, runtime, and semantic.\n",
    "\n",
    "114. Syntax refers to the structure of a program and rules about that structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "115. ***Syntax errors*** involve things like indentation, parenthesis, etc. The Python interpreter expects the language to be structured a specific way, and throws a syntax error when it's not.\n",
    "\n",
    "116. ***Runtime errors***, or ***exceptions***: appears after a program has started running. These errors indicate something unexpected has happened that interrupts or stops the program execution. \n",
    "\n",
    "117. Things that can cause a runtime error include:\n",
    "- Misspelled or incorrectly capitalized variables or function names\n",
    "- Dividing by zero\n",
    "- Mismatched data types (i.e. attempting to perform operations on data of the wrong type)\n",
    "- Attempting to use a type conversion function on a value that can't be converted\n",
    "\n",
    "118. Semantic: relates to meaning. \n",
    "\n",
    "119. ***Semantic errors*** have to do with the meaning (or purpose/intent) of your code. Semantic errors don't show up as error messages-but the program will not do what you expect it to do. \n",
    "\n",
    "120. The debugging strategies discussed here will focus on semantic errors but are useful for all types of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stepwise debugging in Spyder\n",
    "\n",
    "121. Spyder will catch many syntax and runtime errors. \n",
    "\n",
    "122. Hover over a red `X` by any of your lines of code to see more information about a possible error.\n",
    "\n",
    "123. Spyder integrates the enhanced `ipdb` debugger, which gives you robust options for troubleshooting or debugging your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "124. Specifically, the debugger will let you run a program line by line, running a single line of code and waiting for you to tell it to continue.\n",
    "\n",
    "125. Running your program through this kind of debugging is immensely valuable for tracking down bugs or catching complex issues in a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "126. This mode of debugging includes the following possible steps or \"moves\":\n",
    "- Continue (run the program until the next breakpoint)\n",
    "- Step in (executes the next line of code; if the next line of code is a function, the debugger will 'step into' the first line of that function)\n",
    "- Step over (executes the next line of code, but will not go line-by-line through the function; the debugger 'steps over' the function code and waits for the function call to return)\n",
    "- Step out (lets you step out of a function if you used step in and want to 'step out' of the function)\n",
    "- Stop (stops debugging and terminates the program)\n",
